## p5 Sketch Library

This project is a simple wrapper around p5 sketches.

To create a new sketch, you can amend the 'someSketch.ts' class, adding in whatever drawing and state you require.

If you want to create multiple sketches, you can switch which one is loaded by editing App.tsx. You will also need to add any files that you create to the 'index.ts' in the sketches folder.
